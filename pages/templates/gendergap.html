                            The Philippines remains the top country in Asia in terms of 
                            closing the gender gap, according to the Global Gender Gap 
                            Report 2020 of the World Economic Forum. <br><br>

                            The report shows that the Philippines has closed 78% of its 
                            overall gender gap, garnering a score of 0.781 (down by 1.8 
                            percentage points from .799 in 2019). With this, it ranked 
                            16th out of 153 countries with the narrowest gap between men 
                            and women, dropping by 8 notches from its place last year.
                            <br><br>
                            Notably, it remains as the sole Asian country that made it to 
                            the top twenty tier; followed by Lao Peopleâ€™s Democratic 
                            Republic which ranked 43rd.

                            The Global Gender Gap Report 2020 measured countries on 
                            their progress towards gender parity in four dimensions: 
                            economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment,
                             health and survival, and political empowerment.
